## To receive the message, please decode the text in cedrone.txt using Huffman encodings: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/huffman-coding-greedy-algo-3/ (Scrolling down directly to the solutions will get you flagged)

## The encoding is letter-based (i.e. each letter should match to a binary representation; conversely, each binary representation matches to one letter)

## Use the English letter monogram frequencies table from here for the encoding: http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/letter-frequencies-various-languages/english-letter-frequencies/
